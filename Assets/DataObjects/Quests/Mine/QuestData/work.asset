  StepDescription: "You start to move the ore. This time, none of the lost skills
    come to mind and you have to adapt on the spot. \nAfter several hours of work,
    you throw the last batch of ore into the receiver.\nAs soon as the last piece
    gets inside, the receiver doors quickly close, pinching your hand."
