  StepDescription: 'Your hands move automatically. Piece by piece you place the parts
    in the right order and the device begins to take on a finished look.

    A shiny
    cylinder covered in strange patterns with a single button on it. Your hand reaches
    out and presses the button. The cylinder opens like a metallic flower, setting
    in motion the mechanisms inside that begin to creak and hum. Inside the cylinder
    there is a wooden figure of a four-legged animal strung on a pole. The pole rotates
    the animal under the piercing screech of the mechanisms. '
