  StepDescription: You find what's left of a massive robot - collapsed against a
    stalagmite, its body tangled in crystal and rust. One arm still clutches a weapon
    fused into its frame, humming faintly with residual energy. Its chest plate is
    cracked and exposed, easier to reach. There's no sign of life, but the silence
    here feels watchful.
