  StepDescription: "Tucked between two crystal-covered rocks, you spot a nest\u2014woven
    from wires, bones, and shredded instruction manuals. Curled inside is a lizard-shaped
    creature with feline eyes and twitching antennae. It\u2019s asleep. Right next
    to it, nestled like an egg, is a shiny accumulator battery humming with power."
