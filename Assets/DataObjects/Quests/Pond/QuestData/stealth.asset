  StepDescription: "You begin to sneak past the creatures. Trying to keep your distance
    and hide behind rocks, you move along the shore. \nAlmost reaching your destination,
    you see another group of creatures moving towards you. \nLuckily for you, their
    attention is drawn to other creatures and they run past your hiding place and
    engage in a fight with each other.\nTaking advantage of the moment, you quickly
    leave this place"
